# Planned Site Update for yurt-tech.net
### Overview:
Currently, yurt-tech.net is just a radio player. I want to update it with a few new pages to make it feel like an actual homepage for my various projects. Here's what i'm thinking:

A static top navbar that links to the following pages

- Home page
- "Worlds" 
- "Tools"
- "Imagery"
- "Yurt Radio"
- "Notes"

I want to keep things simple, no overdesigned card UI or anything like that. I am aiming for austere, technical, monospace and serif fonts, expressionist. Minimal gradients. Like a lab notebook or technical diagram.

## Home Page
My vision for the home page is a simple splash screen with the Yurt Tech logo. I've been messing with Unicorn Studio to generate some animated WebGL graphics with some effects like film grain and bloom over an animated abstract shape and the Yurt Tech logo overlayed.

My options are:
- Recreate the render with WebGL
- Pay $14 to export what I made on Unicorn.studio

I really would prefer not to pay the $14 just to export something so prioritize recreating it somehow.

No bio blurb, just cool ass logo.

## Worlds
This page will showcase my game projects. I'd like a layout that allows me to insert a primary image of the game on one side, and a brief blurb about the project next to the image. The blurb should be something like:
- Title
- development status
- description of the game
- "more info" link to the games dedicated page

The dedicated pages will go in to detail about the game, tools, implementation strategy, etc.

## Tools
This page will be similar to the worlds page but without the screenshots. I'd like to have a place to localize my non-game projects. These don't need dedicated pages, just a short blurb and link to github

## Imagery
This will be an image gallery for my artwork, photography, and game screenshots. I'd like to devise some way of sorting the images by each category. I'd also like to implement the following features:
- on hover, bring up some light info about the image e.g. title or subcategory
- ability to change icon size. doesnt need to be fancy, just a button that switches from large(default) to small and back.

## Yurt Radio
This should just be the current yurt radio page. May need to update the style to keep things consistent but functionally it can work the same.

## Notes
I'm on the fence about this section. I want to share devblogs and other writings on things, thoughts on life and whatnot. Open to suggestions on how to do this easily with minimal overhead. Doesn't need to be fancy.
