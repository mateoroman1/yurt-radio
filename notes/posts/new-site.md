I've been wanting to update this site in order to host all the projects that me and everybody else is working on. I've got some stuff planned for the future but, importantly,
there's a space for the two YurtTech games, and a section to post devblogs. I never liked having everything spread out across a multitude of different sites so building a place
where all of our cool stuff can be found in one spot is something I've been wanting for a long time!

## What's Next

- Expanding on the radio page, making it more navigable.
- Update info on the game pages with more screenshots and concept artwork
- Bring over all my artwork to the gallery page

## Yurt Tech

Currently, we're making a ton of progress on **Brutal Online**, our multiplayer ARPG game. Taking lessons learned from our first project (which is still in development),
we are limiting scope hard, allowing us to focus on the big technical challenge of multiplayer. Thankfully, this has been aided by some great open-source projects on Github
and the awesome built-in multiplayer functionality of Godot 4. More to come!
